c     This is a utility program to convert EQ6 input files from
c     one version level to another and from one format to another.
c     This program is most conveniently run using the XCIF6 utility
c     discussed below. It may also be run directly.
c
c     The old input file is known as 'input'. It is preserved in the
c     conversion. The new input file is known as 'newin'. The version
c     levels are:
c
c       '6.0' = versions 6.0-6.1 (3245.0288, 3245.0888)
c       '7.0' = versions 7.0-7.1
c       '7.2' = version 7.2
c       '8.0' = version 8.0
c
c     The formats are:
c
c       'W' = compact
c       'D' = menu-style
c
c     Version level '8.0' is presently not accessible. 'D' format does
c     not exist for version level '6.0'.
c
c     To specify the choice of version level and format of the new
c     input file, use the control file IXCON. The same control file
c     also governs the EQ3NR input file converter XCON3. A copy of
c     the contents of this file can be found in the comments in
c     EQLIBU/rddixc.f.
c
c     This code automatically determines the format of the old input
c     file. It may have trouble determining the version level, however.
c     It will first look for a string of the form 'Version level= X.X'
c     or 'Version number= X.X' in the first title of the first problem
c     on this file. Here 'X.X' denotes the version level. If none is
c     found, the code will use a default value specified on the IXCON
c     file. If no IXCON file is present, the code will use a default
c     specified in the main program.
c
c     If a version level marker as described above exists on the old
c     input file, it will be modified on the new input file to give
c     its correct version level. If no version level marker is on the
c     old input file, one will be added to the new input file.
c
c     The version level and format of the new input file may match
c     those of the old input file. The new input file may be identical
c     to the old one, or made somewhat more pretty.
c
c     As noted above, it is more convenient to run XCON6 using the
c     interface software XCIF6 than to run XCON6 directly. On a UNIX
c     system, XCIF6 is a symbolic link to the shell script xcif36RXX,
c     where RXX is a revision number (R01, R02, R03, etc.). On a
c     PC system, XCIF6 is a Fortran program (XCIF6.EXE; the source
c     code file is XCIF6.FOR) containing DOS system calls. XCIF6
c     replaces the specified input files. XCIF6 also creates the
c     IXCON control file used by XCON6, and deletes it prior to
c     completing execution. To convert a set of EQ6 input files from
c     version level 7.2 ('W' or 'D' format) to version level 8.0,
c     'W' format, enter:
c
c       xcif6 7.2 8.0 W *.6i
c
c     To convert the same files to 'D' format instead, enter:
c
c       xcif6 7.2 8.0 D *.6i
c
c     XCON3 and XCIF3 are analogues of XCON6 and XCIF6, respectively.
c     They perform the analogous conversions of EQ3NR input files.
c
c     This code requires subroutines from the following EQ3/6 libraries:
c
c       EQLIBU
c
c
c-----------------------------------------------------------------------
c
c     This subroutine is designed to ensure that the copyright statement
c     and legal and other disclaimers appear at the beginning of the
c     concatenated source code for XCON6. Concatenation is normally
c     alphabetical, hence the form of the name. This subroutine returns
c     the stage and version numbers of this computer code.
c
c     This subroutine is called by:
c
c       XCON6/xcon6.f

c
