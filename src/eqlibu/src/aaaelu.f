c     This library supports various EQ3/6 codes. It contains subroutines
c     with generic utility and mathematical functions. The EQLIB libary
c     contains subroutines that address elements of geochemical modeling
c     calculations that are common to EQ3NR and EQ6. However, it does
c     not contain subroutines that deal with calculations specific to
c     activity coefficient models. The EQLIBG library contains those
c     subroutines. The EQLIBU library contains subroutines with generic
c     utility and mathematical functions.

c     This subroutine is designed to ensure that the copyright statement
c     and legal and other disclaimers appear at the beginning of the
c     concatenated source code for EQLIBU. Concatenation is normally
c     alphabetical, hence the form of the name. This subroutine is
c     generally called by the main program of any code that utilizes
c     subroutines from this library. It returns the stage and version
c     numbers of this library.
c
c     This subroutine is called by:
c
c       EQPT/eqpt.f
c       EQ3NR/eq3nr.f
c       EQ6/eq6.f
c       XCON3/xcon3.f
c       XCON6/xcon6.f
