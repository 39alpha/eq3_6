A,Description= 'React a Ca/Na ion exchanger with seawater',
A,Version level= 8.0,
A,Revised 08/04/97    Revisor= T.J. Wolery,
A,This is part of the EQ3/6 Test Case Library,
A,,
A,  React a Ca/Na ion exchanger with seawater in closed system. The trace,
A,amount of exchanger initially present and in equilibrium with the seawater,
A,is nearly saturated with Na. The reactant exchanger is nearly saturated,
A,with Ca.,
A,,
A,  Purpose: to test the generic ion exchange modeling capability in the case,
A,of an exchanger reactant.,
A,,
A,  This problem has no actual redox aspect. The oxygen fugacity was set to,
