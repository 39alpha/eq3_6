A,  Purpose: to test the code's ability to deal with a rapid and extreme,
A,change in redox conditions. The log fO2 behaves almost like a step function;,
A,dropping from a high value to a very low one once the original dissolved,
A,oxygen content of the water is basically exhausted.,
A,very low value.,
