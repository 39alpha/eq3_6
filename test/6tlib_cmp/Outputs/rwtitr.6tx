A,  Simulate a standard alkalinity titration of the water from the the river,
A,water test case of Nordstrom et al. (1979; Table III). This calculation is,
A,initialized by the EQ3NR input file rwpar.3i. The model constraints on that,
A,file include all solute components present above 0.05 mg/L; plus nitrite;,
A,sulfide; iron; and aluminum. Other solutes are ignored (the full river water,
A,test case is in the EQ3NR input file rwtst.3i). They are not significant,
A,with regard to the alkalinity of this water.,
