A,EQ6 input file name= calhal90.6i,
A,Description= 'Calcite saturated NaCl brine; after PHRQPITZ test problem 5b',
A,Version level= 8.0,
A,Revised 06/03/10    Revisor= T.J. Wolery,
A,This is part of the EQ3/6 Test Case Library,
A,,
A,  Add halite (NaCl) to the calcite saturated fresh water defined in the,
A,EQ3NR test case input file calnacl.3i; until halite saturation is reached.,
A,Saturation with calcite is maintained by adding calcite as a reactant.,
A,Because the solution is initially saturated; the calcite reactant is almost,
A,immediately converted to product mineral status; regardless of the value of,
A,specified relative rate of dissolution. The log pCO2 is fixed at -2.0 by,
A,means of an nffg option. This is test problem 5b from the PHRQPITZ manual,
A,(Plummer et al.; 1988). This problem has no redox aspect. Here the,
A,temperature is increased to 90C.,

A,,
A,This database file represents a combination of the Pitzer parameters for,
A,major cations and anions found in data0.ypf (renamed data0.ypf.R0)(DTN:,
A,SN0302T0510102.002) and added Pitzer parameters for actinide and transition,
A,metal species. However; the listed solid and aqueous species in this,
A,data0.ypf.R2 database are somewhat different from those in data0.ypf.R0.,
A,Some log K values for solids and aqueous species were actually taken from,
