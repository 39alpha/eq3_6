A,EQ6 input file name= evapsw60.6i,
A,Description= 'Evaporate sea water',
A,Version level= 8.0,
A,Revised 06/06/10    Revisor= T.J. Wolery,
A,This is part of the EQ3/6 Test Case Library,
A,,
A,  Evaporate sea water by treating H2O as a reactant with a negative,
A,relative dissolution rate. The log pCO2 is fixed at the atmospheric value,
A,of -3.5. The sea water model was constructed by running the EQ3NR test case,
A,input file swmajp.3i; using the Harvie-Moller-Weare model (Harvie; Moller;,
A,and Weare; 1984). A similar EQ6 test case input is evswgyha.6i; which,
A,permits only dolomite; gypsum; and halite to form as product minerals.,
A,Note that the tempearture here is 60C.,

A,,
A,This database file represents a combination of the Pitzer parameters for,
A,major cations and anions found in data0.ypf (renamed data0.ypf.R0)(DTN:,
A,SN0302T0510102.002) and added Pitzer parameters for actinide and transition,
A,metal species. However; the listed solid and aqueous species in this,
A,data0.ypf.R2 database are somewhat different from those in data0.ypf.R0.,
A,Some log K values for solids and aqueous species were actually taken from,
