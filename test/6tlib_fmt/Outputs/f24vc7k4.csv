A,EQ6 input file name= f24vc7k4.6i,
A,Description= 'React three salt minerals to find invariant point 'K4'',
A,Version level= 8.0,
A,Revised 10/13/08    Revisor= T.J. Wolery,
A,This is part of the WIPP EQ3/6-FMT comparison study.,
A,,
A,  Add 20.0 moles of Potassium Carbonate (K2CO3.3/2H2O) and 10 moles each of,
A,K-Na-Carbonate (KNaCO3.6H2O) and Sylvite (KCl) to 'pure' water containing,
A,trace amounts of Na; K; Cl; and HCO3. A reaction path is calculated to,
A,achieve this. The objective is to find the invariant point 'K4'.,
A,The invariant point involves these three minerals.,
A,,
A,  Note that ClO4-; O2(aq); and H2(aq) are suppressed in the initializing,
A,EQ3NR run. That carries over into the present EQ6 run. This is done for,
A,consistency with the original FMT test problem. Here also iopt(15) is set,
