A,EQ6 input file name= c4pgwb.6i,
A,Description= 'React salts and Am; Th; and Np solids with GWB + organics',
A,Version level= 8.0,
A,Revised 12/30/08    Revisor= T.J. Wolery,
A,This is part of the WIPP EQ3/6-FMT comparison study.,
A,,
A,  Add 1.0 mole each of Am(OH)3(s); ThO2(am); and KNpO2CO3; 10.0 moles each,
A,of Anhydrite; Brucite; and Halite; and 1.0 mole of Hydromagnesite5424,
A,to GWB brine (with organics) containing trace amounts of Am; Th; and Np. A,
A,reaction path is calculated to accomplish this. This run is based on the FMT,
A,input file fmt_cra1bc_gwb_hmag_orgs_007.inguess (Run #7 of Brush; 2005).,
A,,
A,  Note that ClO4-; O2(aq); and H2(aq) are suppressed in the initializing,
A,EQ3NR run. That carries over into the present EQ6 run. This is done for,
A,consistency with the original FMT test problem. Here also iopt(15) is set,
