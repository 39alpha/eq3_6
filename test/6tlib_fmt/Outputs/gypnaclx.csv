A,
A,EQ6 input file name= gypnaclx.6i,
A,Description= 'React Halite and Gypsum to find the mutual solubility point',
A,Version level= 8.0,
A,Revised 12/30/08    Revisor= T.J. Wolery,
A,This is part of the WIPP EQ3/6-FMT comparison study.,
A,,
A,  Add 10.0 moles of Halite (NaCl) and 1.0 mole of Gypsum (CaSO4.2H2O) to,
A,'pure' water containing trace amounts of Na; K; Cl; and SO4. A reaction path,
A,is calculated to achieve this. The objective is to find the invariant point,
A,representing the mutual solubility of these two minerals. This problem,
A,is a simplification of the original EQ3/6 test case gypnacl.6i. This problem,
A,is closely analogous to those in the 'f24vc7' series that are also used in,
A,the WIPP EQ3/6-FMT comparison study.,
A,,
A,  Note that ClO4-; O2(aq); and H2(aq) are suppressed in the initializing,
