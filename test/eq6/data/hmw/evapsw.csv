A,Running EQ6 from EQ3/6-V8.0a (R43a) for PC,
A,---,
A,
A,EQ6 input file name= evapsw.6i,
A,Description= 'Evaporate sea water',
A,Version level= 8.0,
A,Revised 02/18/97    Revisor= T.J. Wolery,
A,This is part of the EQ3/6 Test Case Library,
A,,
A,  Evaporate sea water by treating H2O as a reactant with a negative,
A,relative dissolution rate. The log pCO2 is fixed at the atmospheric value,
A,of -3.5. The sea water model was constructed by running the EQ3NR test case,
A,input file swmajp.3i; using the Harvie-Moller-Weare model (Harvie; Moller;,
A,and Weare; 1984). A similar EQ6 test case input is evswgyha.6i; which,
A,permits only dolomite; gypsum; and halite to form as product minerals.,
A,,
A,  Purpose: to test the ability of the code to deal with very high ionic,
A,strength brines.,
