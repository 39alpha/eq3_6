A,EQ6 input file name= calhal.6i,
A,Description= 'Calcite saturated NaCl brine; PHRQPITZ test problem 5b',
A,Version level= 8.0,
A,Revised 02/18/97    Revisor= T.J. Wolery,
A,This is part of the EQ3/6 Test Case Library,
A,,
A,  Add halite (NaCl) to the calcite saturated fresh water defined in the,
A,EQ3NR test case input file calnacl.3i; until halite saturation is reached.,
A,Saturation with calcite is maintained by adding calcite as a reactant.,
A,Because the solution is initially saturated; the calcite reactant is almost,
A,immediately converted to product mineral status; regardless of the value of,
A,specified relative rate of dissolution. The log pCO2 is fixed at -2.0 by,
A,means of an nffg option. This is test problem 5b from the PHRQPITZ manual,
A,(Plummer et al.; 1988). This problem has no redox aspect.,
