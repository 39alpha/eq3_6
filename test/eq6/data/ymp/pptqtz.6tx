A,EQ6 input file name= pptqtz.6i,
A,Description= 'Precipitate quartz using Rimstidt and Barnes rate law',
A,Version level= 8.0,
A,Revised 02/18/97    Revisor= T.J. Wolery,
A,This is part of the EQ3/6 Test Case Library,
A,,
A,  Precipitate quartz from supersaturated solution at 105C; using the rate,
A,law of Rimstidt and Barnes (1980). This is test problem 1 from Delany;,
A,Puigdomenech; and Wolery (1986; p. 19-21; 31-33); which simulates an experi-,
A,ment (Run 2E) reported by Rimstidt and Barnes (1980; p. 1687-1688; Figure 2),
A,and uses their rate law model; which is independent of pH. Another EQ6 test,
A,case input file; pptqtza.6i; runs the same problem; but uses a rate law,
A,model from Knauss and Wolery (1988) that includes dependence on pH.,
A,,
A,  Purpose: to test the kinetics mode of EQ6. Results may be compared with,

A,This EQ3/6 database file is an update to the previous version of the,
A,thermodynamic database data0.ymp.R2 DTN: MO0210SPATHDYN.000. The changes,
A,result from both correcting errors and adding new data. The changes in,
