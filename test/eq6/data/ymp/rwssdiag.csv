A,EQ6 input file name= rwssdiag.6i,
A,Description= 'River water-sandstone diagenesis',
A,Version level= 8.0,
A,Revised 02/18/97    Revisor= T.J. Wolery,
A,This is part of the EQ3/6 Test Case Library,
A,,
A,  Simulate river water-sandstone diagenesis; using a scenario from Bruton,
A,(1989). The sandstone is an orthoquartzite selected by Bruton (1989) from,
A,data reported by Pettijohn (1975). Mineral dissolution kinetics is modeled,
A,using fixed relative rates. The temperature increases from 10C to 300C.,
A,,
A,  Purpose: to test the ability of the code to compute a reaction path model,
A,in a moderately complex system in which the temperature changes along a,
A,specified path.,
