A,Running EQ6 from EQ3/6-V8.0a (R43a) for PC,
A,---,
A,
A,EQ6 input file name= methane.6i,
A,Description= 'Methane reduction of an oxygenated system',
A,Version level= 8.0,
A,Revised 02/18/97    Revisor= T.J. Wolery,
A,This is part of the EQ3/6 Test Case Library,
A,,
A,  React methane with an oxygenated; calcite and hematite saturated solution,
A,at 25C. The system initially contains 0.1 mmol of hematite and an excess of,
A,calcite. This is test problem 4 of INTERA (1983; p. 74-85).,
A,,
A,  Purpose: to compare against results obtained in a previous comparison of,
A,EQ3/6 with PHREEQE (Parkhurst; Thorstenson; and Plummer; 1980) made by,
A,INTERA (1983). This tests the ability of the code to deal with radical,
A,changes in redox conditions; as the system moves from strongly oxidizing to,
A,strongly reducing.,
