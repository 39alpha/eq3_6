A,,
A,  React spent nuclear fuel with J-13 well water. The O2 and CO2 fugacities,
A,are fixed at atmospheric values using nffg options. The spent nuclear fuel,
A,is treated as a special reactant. One 'mole' is equivalent to 100 grams. The,
A,spent fuel composition corresponds to average PWR spent fuel with burnup of,
A,33;000 MWd/MTIHM at 1;000 years This was computed by Henry Shaw (LLNL;,
A,1/12/89) as a correction to the data published in Table 2 of Bruton and Shaw,
A,(1988).,
