A,  Simulate a standard alkalinity titration of the J-13 well water reported,
A,by Harrar et al. (1990). This calculation is initialized by the EQ3NR test,
A,case input file j13w.3i.,
A,,
A,  The analytical data relevant to the carbonate system is given in terms of,
A,alkalinity. Harrar et al. (1990) gives this as 128.9 mg/L 'HCO3-'. The HCO3-,
A,total concentration was estimated as 140.4 mg/L by looking at the ratio of,
A,HCO3- species to putative total HCO3-.,
