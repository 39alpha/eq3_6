A,EQ6 input file name= f24vc7m.6i,
A,Description= 'React four salt minerals to find invariant point 'M'',
A,Version level= 8.0,
A,Revised 10/13/08    Revisor= T.J. Wolery,
A,This is part of the WIPP EQ3/6-FMT comparison study.,
A,,
A,  Add 8.0 moles each of Aphthitalite/Glaserite (NaK3(SO4)2); Halite (NaCl);,
A,Picromerite/Schoenite (K2Mg(SO4)2.6H2O); and Sylvite (KCl) to 'pure' water,
A,containing trace amounts of Na; K; Mg; SO4; and Cl. A reaction path is,
A,calculated to achieve this. The objective is to find the invariant point,
A,'M'. The invariant point involves these four minerals.,
A,,
A,  Note that ClO4-; O2(aq); and H2(aq) are suppressed in the initializing,
A,EQ3NR run. That carries over into the present EQ6 run. This is done for,
A,consistency with the original FMT test problem. Here also iopt(15) is set,
