A,EQ6 input file name= pptqtza.6i,
A,Description= 'Precipitate quartz using Knauss and Wolery rate law',
A,Version level= 8.0,
A,Revised 02/18/97    Revisor= T.J. Wolery,
A,This is part of the EQ3/6 Test Case Library,
A,,
A,  Precipitate quartz from supersaturated solution at 105C; using the two-,
A,term TST-form rate law of Knauss and Wolery (1988). This is adapted from,
A,test problem 1 of Delany; Puigdomenech; and Wolery (1986; p. 19-21; 31-33);,
A,which simulates an experiment (Run 2E) reported by Rimstidt and Barnes,
A,(1980; p. 1687-1688; Figure 2). Another EQ6 test case input file; pptqtz.6i;,
A,runs the same problem; but uses the Rimstidt and Barnes one-term TST-form,
A,rate model.,
A,,
A,  Purpose: to test the kinetics mode of EQ6 in the case of a rate law that,
