A,EQ6 input file name= heatqf.6i,
A,Description= 'Heat a quenched fluid to find the in situ pH',
A,Version level= 8.0,
A,Revised 02/18/97    Revisor= T.J. Wolery,
A,This is part of the EQ3/6 Test Case Library,
A,,
A,  Heat quenched fluid from a hydrothermal experiment involving the reaction,
A,of water with vitric tuff. This fluid is for day 16 of the 150C experiment,
A,reported by Knauss and Peifer (1986; Appendix B2; p. 31). In Table 4; p. 12;,
A,they report a calculated in situ pH of 6.39.,
A,,
A,  Purpose: to test the ability of the code to compute the high temperature;,
A,in situ pH of a fluid from the measured quench pH.,
A,,
A,  In previous versions of this test case; the temperature was stepped up,
