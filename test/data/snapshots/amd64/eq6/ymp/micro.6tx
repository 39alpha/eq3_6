A,EQ6 input file name= micro.6i,
A,Description= 'Microcline dissolution in pH 4 HCl',
A,Version level= 8.0,
A,Revised 02/18/97    Revisor= T.J. Wolery,
A,This is part of the EQ3/6 Test Case Library,
A,,
A,  React 'Maximum_Microcline' (KAlSi3O8) with a pH 4.0 HCl solution at 25C.,
A,There is no time frame in this calculation. Precipitation of quartz; chal-,
A,cedony; and tridymite is prevented by means of nxmod suppress options that,
A,are inherited from the initializing EQ3NR input file; ph4hcl.3i. This is,
A,test problem 3 of INTERA (1983; p. 65-73); it is similar to test problem 5,
A,of Parkhurst; Thorstenson; and Plummer (1980). INTERA (1983) reported that,
A,the product minerals formed were gibbsite; kaolinite; and muscovite. The run,
A,terminates when the solution becomes saturated with microcline.,
