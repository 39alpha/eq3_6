A,---,
A,
A,EQ6 input file name= dedolo.6i,
A,Description= 'Dedolomitization with increasing temperature',
A,Version level= 8.0,
A,Revised 02/18/97    Revisor= T.J. Wolery,
A,This is part of the EQ3/6 Test Case Library,
A,,
A,  React gypsum with carbonate aquifer solution in equilibrium with dolomite,
A,and calcite; thus driving a dedolomitization reaction (conversion of,
A,dolomite to calcite). The temperature is increased linearly so that its,
A,value is 75C at unit value of reaction progress. The amount of gypsum,
A,dissolved at this point is 10 mmol. This is test problem 5 of INTERA (1983;,
A,p. 86-95).,
A,,
A,  Purpose: to compare against results obtained in a previous comparison of,
A,EQ3/6 with PHREEQE (Parkhurst; Thorstenson; and Plummer; 1980) made by,
