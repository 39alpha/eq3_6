A,EQ6 input file name= crisqtz.6i,
A,Description= 'Convert cristobalite to quartz at 250C',
A,Version level= 8.0,
A,Revised 02/18/97    Revisor= T.J. Wolery,
A,This is part of the EQ3/6 Test Case Library,
A,,
A,  Convert cristobalite ('Cristobalite(alpha)') to quartz at 250C; using the,
A,rate law models of Rimstidt and Barnes (1980). This is a kinetics problem,
A,that extends over about 10 years of model time. The aqueous solution is,
A,initially saturated with cristobalite (about 708 mg/L dissolved SiO2; or,
A,322 mg/L dissolved Si). This is test problem 3 from Delany; Puigdomenech;,
A,and Wolery (1986; p. 22-23; 38-40).,
A,,
A,  Purpose: to test the kinetics mode of EQ6 in the case of simultaneous,
A,dissolution and precipitation of a single component (SiO2). Results may be,
