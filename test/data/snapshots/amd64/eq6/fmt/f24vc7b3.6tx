A,EQ6 input file name= f24vc7b3.6i,
A,Description= 'React three salt minerals to find invariant point 'B3'',
A,Version level= 8.0,
A,Revised 12/30/08    Revisor= T.J. Wolery,
A,This is part of the WIPP EQ3/6-FMT comparison study.,
A,,
A,  Add 10.0 moles each of Halite (NaCl); Borax (Na2B4O7.10H2O); and Teepleite,
A,(NaBO2.NaCl.2H2O) to 'pure' water containing trace amounts of Na; Cl; and,
A,BO3. A reaction path is calculated to achieve this. The objective is to,
A,find the invariant point 'B3'. The invariant point involves these three,
A,minerals.,
A,,
A,  Note that ClO4-; O2(aq); and H2(aq) are suppressed in the initializing,
A,EQ3NR run. That carries over into the present EQ6 run. This is done for,
A,consistency with the original FMT test problem. Here also iopt(15) is set,
