A,This is part of the EQ3/6 Test Case Library,
A,,
A,  Add H2SO4 to epsomite saturated water to compute the solubility of,
A,minerals in the system MgSO4-H2SO4-H2O. Note that some epsomite is also,
A,added to the system early in the run. The initial mass ratio of epsomite,
A,to solution is not identical to that in the version 7 line equivalent of,
A,this input file. Thus; some details in the results will vary. The important,
A,compositional relationships should remain the same.,
A,,
A,  Purpose: to allow comparison of the results with Figure 4d of Harvie;,
A,Moller; and Weare (1984; p. 730). The activity coefficients of the aqueous,
