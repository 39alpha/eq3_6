     data0.fmt.R1
     PITZER THERMODYNAMIC DATABASE (12/04/2008)
     data0.fmt.R1
     
      This file contains two revisions to data0.fmt.R0:
     
      ***** Aphi = 0.392, not 0.39 *****
      ***** beta(1) for NaCl = 0.2664, not 0.2644 *****
     
     Revision 1: Harvie et al. (1984) gave Aphi = 0.39. As documented by L.N.
     Plummer, D.L. Parkhurst, G.W. Fleming, and S.A. Dunkle, A Computer
     Program Incorporating Pitzer's Equations for Calculation of Geochemical
     Reactions in Brines, U.S. Geological Survey, Water-Resources Investigation
     Report 88-4153 (see p. 3, the results of Harvie et al. (1984) are actually
     consistent with an Aphi value of 0.392 (see Plummer et al.,1988, p. 3).
     
     Revision 2: the beta(1) for NaCl of 0.2644 given by Harvie et al. (1984)
     appears to be a typographical error. The value of 0.2664 is given in the
     earlier paper by C.E. Harvie and J.H. Weare (1980, The prediction of miner
     solubilities in natural waters: the Na-K-Mg-Ca-Cl-SO4-H2O system from zero
     to high concentration at 25C, Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta, v. 44,
     p. 981-997; see Table 1, p. 987). There appears to be nothing of substance
     in the subsequent Weare and company literature describing a revision, just
     different value appearing in a table in the 1984 paper. The 0.2664 value
     is also cited by Pitzer (1991, Chapter 3, Ion Interaction Approach: Theory
     and Correlation, p. 75-153 in Pitzer, K.S., ed., Activity Coefficients in
     Electrolyte Solutions, 2nd edition, CRC Press, Boca Raton; see Table 2,
     p. 100). This is also the value given by Plummer et al. (1988, p. 150).
     There may be no practical difference between the 0.2644 and 0.2664
     values.
     
      ************************************************************
     
     This datafile is a corrected translation of the "fmt_050405.chemdat"
     datafile used with the WIPP code FMT. The purpose of this datafile
     is to transfer the WIPP geochemistry model from FMT to EQ3/6.
     
     This datafile uses the standard form of Pitzer's equations relevant to
     the temperature range.
     
     Pitzer parameters are represented by the 25C-centric four-term temperature
     function given by:
     
     x(T) = a1 + a2*(1/T - 1/298.15) + a3*ln(T/298.15) + a4*(T - 298.15)
     
     where T is temperature in Kelvin and a1 through a4 denote the temperature
     function fitting coefficients for the temperature-dependent Pitzer
     parameters. This is the form used by the Yucca Mountain Project. The form
     itself is sufficient to accurately describe data up to a temperature of at
     least 250C, although the YMP database is only qualified up to 140C. At the
     present time, this WIPP database is for 25C only. The form of the equation
     is that a1 is the 25C value. Consequently, the a2, a3,and a4 constants
     can simply be assigned a value of zero.
     
     Some data blocks provide comments on the gathered Pitzer parameters and
     solid phase solubility data to make the user aware of any convention
     adopted in the data extraction/compilation process.
     
     The following comments apply to data0.fmt.R0:
     
       Data for O2(aq) and H2(aq) were added from YMP DTN: SN0302T0510102.002
       (data0.ypf.R1). Pitzer data were not included for H2(aq) because they
       were not available from the YMP DTN source. The O2(aq) data were added
       to allow calculations involving the oxygen fugacity, and this can be
       accomplished for essentially non-redox problems by adding a trace amount
       of O2(aq) or H2(aq). Until the requisite set of Pitzer data for H2(aq)
       have been added, this database should not be used to model systems with
       non-trace amounts of that species.
     
       Data for uranium and plutonium were removed, as these elements
       are not included in the present WIPP geochemistry model. These data
       are not needed for the EQ3/6-FMT code comparison study.
     
       The thermodynamic data for CO2(g) are based on data hard-wired into
       FMT v. 2.4.

|Description= "Sea water, major ions, Pitzer's equations, Pitzer pH = 8.2526"  |
|Version level= 8.0                                                            |
|Revised 08/28/09    Revisor= T.J. Wolery                                      |
|This is part of the WIPP EQ3/6-FMT comparison study.                          |
|                                                                              |
|  Sea water, including only the major ions. This is a considerably            |
|pared-down version the full benchmark sea water test case of Nordstrom        |
|et al. (1979, Table III). This problem is modified from the EQ3/6 test case   |
|swmajp.3i, which was intended to be used with the data0.hmw data file         |
|based on the model of Harvie, Moller, and Weare (1984). The changes are:      |
|                                                                              |
|    (a) Only molality inputs are used, apart from the pH input. The           |
|        molality values are taken from Nordstrom et al. (1979, Table III),    |
|        where concentrations are given in a variety of units. The             |
|        swmajp.3i problem used some concentration values with units of        |
|        mg/kgH2O.                                                             |
|    (b) To reduce the calculated charge imbalance, inputs for the components  |
|        Br and B(OH)4- are included. They were not in the original            |
|        Harvie-Moller-Weare model (Harvie et al., 1984) and thus were not     |
|        represented on the data0.hmw data file that the swmajp.3i test case   |
|        was intended to be run with. Consequently, Br and B(OH)4- had been    |
|        omitted from that test case.                                          |
|    (c) The original problem specifies an NBS pH of 8.22 and when run         |
|        using the data0.fmt data file (preliminary test case input file       |
|        swmajt.3i) yields a calculated Pitzer pH of 8.2526. Here the          |
|        problem is modified to specify the same Pitzer pH value. This         |
|        This done because FMT cannot accept an NBS pH or pmH as an input.     |
|    (d) The Cl molality has been adjusted very slightly from the original     |
|        0.5657625 value to 0.5658134 to further minimize the charge           |
|        imbalance. This was obtained using the preliminary run using the      |
|        swmajt.3i input file. This minimization is necessary to mitigate      |
|        issues with the way that FMT deals with charge balance. It forces     |
|        adjustment in the mole total for elemental oxygen, and that tends     |
|        to have undesired effects (e.g., the mass of solvent water is not     |
|        exactly 1 kg.)                                                        |
|    (e) The oxygen fugacity has been set to the atmospheric value. In the     |
|        original problem, the Eh was set to +500 mV, which corresponds to a   |
|        lower oxygen fugacity (but still in the "oxidizing" range).           |
|        Essentially, there are no redox reactions represented in the FMT      |
|        model, so this change has no effect on the results.                   |
|                                                                              |
|  The present test case is the only one in the WIPP EQ3/6-FMT comparison      |
|study that uses a pmH as a formal input. The remaining test cases in this     |
|series will either use the Pitzer pH as an input or will use charge balance   |
|to constrain the pH. In future usage of EQ3/6 on WIPP, the pmH is expected    |
|to be used as the usual pH input.                                             |
|                                                                              |
|  The switch iopg(2) is set to -1, so that the reported ionic activities      |
|and activity coefficients are unrescaled (i.e., are on the "Pitzer" scale).   |
|They can therefore be directly compared with corresponding results from FMT.  |
|The "pmH" option still causes the input pH to be interpreted as pmH (pH on    |
|the Mesmer scale).                                                            |
|                                                                              |
|  The density and TDS inputs used here are from the "Seawater" worksheet of   |
|an example of the spreadsheet density calculator, specifically the file       |
|Conc_density_calcs_EV2008.xls. They are included here mainly for illustrative |
|purposes. They do not affect the results, as none of the principal inputs     |
|have a volumetric basis. Similar values were given by Nordstrom et al.        |
|(1979). Note that EQ3/6 will compute the density and TDS for output using     |
|the WIPP brine density model (the model used in FMT).                         |
|                                                                              |
|     Density = 1.02400 g/cm3   from the conc_density spreadsheet              |
|             = 1.02336 g/cm3   from Nordstrom et al. (1979)                   |
|                                                                              |
|  ClO4-, O2(aq), and H2(aq) are suppressed in this problem. ClO4- is treated  |
|as a pseudo-element on the original FMT database, and thus cannot form from   |
|Cl and O in the FMT calculations. The original FMT database lacks O2(aq)      |
|and H2(aq).                                                                   |
|                                                                              |
