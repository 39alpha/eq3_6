A,Running EQ6 from EQ3/6-V8.0a (R43a) for PC,
A,---,
A,
A,EQ6 input file name= swv1sxk.6i,
A,Description= 'Dissolve KCl into seawater with an ion exchanger present',
A,Version level= 8.0,
A,Revised 08/04/97    Revisor= T.J. Wolery,
A,This is part of the EQ3/6 Test Case Library,
A,,
A,  Dissolve KCl (sylvite) into a system containing seawater and a Vanselow,
A,one-site Na-K ion exchanger present. Initially; the exchanger is almost,
A,completely saturated with Na+. The K+ from the KCl dissolution then,
A,displaces Na+ from the exchanger. The run stops when the system becomes,
A,saturated with respect to sylvite.,
A,,
A,  This test case uses Pitzer's equations. It is intended to be used with,
A,the Harvie-Moller-Weare (HMW) data file (after Harvie; Moller; and Weare;,
A,1984).,
