A,EQ6 input file name= gypanhy.6i,
A,Description= 'Gypsum-anhydrite equilibrium; PHRQPITZ test problem 3',
A,Version level= 8.0,
A,Revised 12/02/01    Revisor= T.J. Wolery,
A,This is part of the EQ3/6 Test Case Library,
A,,
A,  Add halite (NaCl) to gypsum-saturated water with a trace of NaCl to com-,
A,pute the phase boundary between gypsum (CaSO4.2H2O) and anhydrite (CaSO4).,
A,This is test problem 3 from the PHRQPITZ manual (Plummer et al.; 1988). It,
A,has no redox aspect. Note that gypsum is added here rapidly at the start to,
A,ensure that saturation with that mineral is maintained. The starting mass,
A,ratio of gypsum to solution is not quite identical to that in the version,
A,7 line equivalent of this input file. Thus; some details in the results,
A,may vary. The important compositional relationships should remain the same.,
