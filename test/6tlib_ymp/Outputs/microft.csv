A,  React 'Maximum_Microcline' (KAlSi3O8) with a pH 4.0 HCl solution at 25C.,
A,This case is identical to that in the EQ6 test case input file micro.6i;,
A,except that reaction here takes place in a fluid-centered flow-through open,
A,system (obtained by setting iopt(1) to 2). There is no time frame in this,
A,calculation. Precipitation of quartz; chalecedony; and tridymite is pre-,
