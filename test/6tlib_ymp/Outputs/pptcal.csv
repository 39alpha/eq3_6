A,Description= 'Precipitate calcite using a TST rate law',
A,Version level= 8.0,
A,Revised 02/18/97    Revisor= T.J. Wolery,
A,This is part of the EQ3/6 Test Case Library,
A,,
A,  Precipitate calcite from supersaturated solution at 25C; using a TST-form,
A,rate law (Delany; Puigdomenech; and Wolery; 1986). This is a form of problem,
A,2 from Delany; Puigdomenech; and Wolery (1986; p. 21-22; 34-37); which,
A,simulates an experiment (Run #7) reported by Reddy; Plummer; and Busenberg,
A,(1981).,
A,,
A,  This problem was formerly known as pptcala.6i. The original pptcal.6i,
A,test case ran the same problem; but with Plummer's activity term rate law,
A,(see Reddy et al.; 1981). EQ3/6 no longer supports the use of that rate law.,
