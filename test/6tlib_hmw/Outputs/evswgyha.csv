A,,
A,  Evaporate sea water by treating H2O as a reactant with a negative relative,
A,dissolution rate. The log pCO2 is fixed at the atmospheric value of -3.5 by,
A,means of an nffg option. Only dolomite; gypsum; and halite are allowed to,
A,precipitate. This is done by means of the nxopt subset-selection option,
A,'all'; which suppresses all minerals; and by the nxopex option; which,
A,permits exceptions (here dolomite; gypsum; and halite) to be specified.,
A,,
A,  Purpose: to compare against results obtained from PHRQPITZ (Plummer et,
A,al.; 1988; p. 124-139). The Harvie-Moller-Weare model (Harvie; Moller;,
