A,  Add the calcite saturated fresh water defined on the EQ3NR test input file,
A,calnacl.3i to the calcite saturated brine defined by the EQ6 test case,
A,calhal.6i. The fresh water is treated as a special reactant; whose,
A,composition was taken from the pickup file generated by running calnacl.3i.,
A,Saturation with calcite is to be maintained; but the log pCO2 is allowed to,
A,drift. The starting calcite-saturated brine system from calhal.6i contains,
A,calcite; halite; and fix_CO2(g). These minerals (two real; one fictive) are,
A,removed when the run begins (some calcite is put back as a reactant; see,
A,below). Because a fixed fugacity option for CO2(g) is not specified; the,
